Explanation of the Jenkinsfile:

Agent:
	The build agent is specified to run in a Docker container using the node:16 Docker image, with the argument -u root to run commands as the root user.
Environment:
	The environment section defines the SNYK_TOKEN environment variable, which is fetched using the credentials function. This token is used for authenticating with Snyk to perform security scans.
Stages:
	Install Dependencies:
    	Installs the project dependencies by running npm install --save.
    	Displays a message indicating the successful installation of dependencies.
	Run Tests:
    	Runs the tests defined in the Node.js project by executing npm test.
    	Displays a message indicating the successful completion of tests.
	Snyk Security Scan:
	    Installs the Snyk CLI tool globally using npm install -g snyk.
	    Optionally, authenticates Snyk using the provided SNYK_TOKEN environment variable (commented in the script).
	    Runs a Snyk security scan with a severity threshold set to "high" using snyk test --severity-threshold=high.
	    Displays a message indicating the completion of the security scan and encourages reviewing for any critical vulnerabilities.
	    The script captures the return status of the snyk test command.
	    If Snyk detects vulnerabilities (i.e., returnStatus is not 0), the pipeline halts with an error message.
Post:
	This block contains actions that run after the stages are completed.
always:
	Displays a message indicating that the pipeline execution is finished, regardless of success or failure.
failure:
	Displays a message if the pipeline fails, asking to review the logs for details.
