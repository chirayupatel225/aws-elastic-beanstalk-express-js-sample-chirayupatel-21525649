Explanation of the Snyk Integration:

Snyk Security Scan:
Installs Snyk globally using npm install -g snyk.
Runs snyk test to check for vulnerabilities in the project dependencies.

Explanation of the Snyk Script to Halt the Pipeline:
The script block captures the return status of the snyk test command.
If Snyk detects vulnerabilities (i.e., returnStatus is not 0), the pipeline halts with an error message.
